## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to inspire trust and focus in the interface. The selection is based on the concepts of 'trust', 'focus', and 'control' which are commonly associated with control panels.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5), close in hue to the primary, to ensure the blue elements stand out against a desaturated, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted violet (#9575CD), an analogous hue, chosen for secondary interactive elements like hover states.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, chosen for its neutral, objective and modern appearance.
- Simple, outlined icons to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Grid-based layout for organized and responsive design.
- Subtle transitions and feedback animations for a polished user experience.
